### DataSet

This repository stores the data collected for our previous ISSRE work and ongoing work.

This catalog contains the data results of the 45 projects we used. In each project we have two folders, "Version1" and "Version2", corresponding to the two versions of the project. 

In each folder,

1) $anti-pattern$.dv8-issue

It provides specific architecture anti-patterns detected in each project.

2) root_other.txt

This shows the core data in this paper, that is, the detection results of **root file** and **other file**. Among them, the first line shows the root file, and the second line shows the other file.



### Tool

You can use [DV8](https://archdia.com/) to open the $anti-pattern$.dv8-issue.
